Building PENG

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

If you run into issues with building from source, please use depends:

    cd depends
	make
	cd ..
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=$PWD/pengcore/depends/$host
    make

Always verify the signatures and checksums.

See doc/build-*.md for instructions on building pengd,
the intended-for-services, no-graphical-interface, reference
implementation of PENG.
